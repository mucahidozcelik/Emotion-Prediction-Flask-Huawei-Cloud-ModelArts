# Emotion-Prediction-Flask-Huawei-Cloud-ModelArts

Hi everyone, we will explore how to build an Emotion Prediction application using Huawei Cloud ModelArts.

Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding human behaviour and developing various applications. Predicting emotions from text has become an important task in natural language processing.

By integrating with Huawei Cloud ModelArts and Flask, we will develop a web-based system that accurately predicts emotions from textual contributions.
